## Product Vision
This app will give our consumers the opportunity to easily talk and discuss ideas, with others, regarding various events through chats and forums, facilitating the connection between users who share similar interests. You will fill guided and relaxed with our super user-friendly calendar and your own personal agenda that let's you see only the events that you want to attend!


---
## Elevator Pitch
Conference attendees are often frustrated with the lack of time they have to communicate and network with others, being unable to experience conferences at their fullest. Our product provides the users the possibility to enjoy the time they spend during conferences, while not having to worry about trivial things, making them feel as though they are in tune with their surroundings. We understand how the attendees feel and how that feeling can be changed. With our app, wasted time will easily be turned into something productive and with personal value.

---
## Requirements
Our main objective is to help the people that attend conferences guiding them through it and enabling them to discuss and share their ideas with others in a simple and easy way.

About the **nonfunctional requirements** we decided it was better to focus on **usability**, since our product will  empower its users with a lot of features, while keeping it simple and intuitive. We want the user to do what it wants, without having to think to much! 
We will also pay particular attention to **reliability** because it is extremely important for us, that the user can always make full use of the app and enjoy its conference without stressing out.
**Portability** is something that we considerate a lot as well, so that all users can make the most of our app, in any platform they want.
 
The **functional requirements** are exposed on the [Use case diagram](#Use-case-diagram) and [User stories](#User-stories) sections.

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module.

## Architecture and Design
In this section we will be talking about the overall software system organization, describing the components of the project and their interrelations and detailing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-lever components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them.

We'll be first explaining the high-level logical structure of the code (**Logical Architecture**) and then the high.level physical structure of the software system (**Physical Architecture**).

### Logical architecture
From the very beginning, the group opted to keep a very simple logical architecture since learning Flutter and the basics off mobile applications development would be the most important obstacles do tackle.

We can decompose the structure of the code in the following packages:
* **Widgets** - holds the most important widgets of the application, focusing mostly on the application's logic.
* **Screens** - provides an interface for the user.
* **Services** - enables the app to get information from the back-end.

When we got the hang of Flutter and tackled the most important aspects of the project the group started working towards a more well defined structure namely the **MVP** (Model View Presenter) which would allow a faster development of the application and easier scalability and maintainability.

![Logical Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-verdade-productions/blob/master/docs/logical_architecture_uml.png)


### Physical architecture
The high-level physical software system is very straightforward since the user only needs to install our mobile application. This application uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as it's backend service meaning that every bit of information about the conference, it's events and it's users are maintained on Firebase services such as [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore),  [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).

![Physycal Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-verdade-productions/blob/master/docs/firebase.jpg)

We opted to use **Firebase** as our backend service since it allows our developers to focus on giving the user an amazing experience without having to worry about about managing data and servers. Firebase is our server, our API and our datastore, all at the same time!
This service provides a **Real Time Database** which uses WebSockets instead of HTTP connections, resulting in a much faster connection since this database does not require an HTTP request but instead the app receives the data as soon as it's updated on the database.
Firebase also provides their clients a simple way to store binary files, such as images, in the [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).
The Firebase Authentication also comes in really handy, since it has a built in email/password authentication system and also supports other types of authentications such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Github. It is a pretty reliable service and lifts us the weight of having to build our own custom authentication system.

One of the hardest decisions was deciding which framework to use when developing the app. It was mainly about choosing between [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) since both of them allows the development of native apps in both IOS and Android. While both frameworks can be quite comparable, Flutter exceeds React Native in terms of performance, since it uses Dart as a language whose code is compiled to machine language (the same does not happen with Javascript).
Flutter has also been trending a lot in the recent past which means the opportunity for us to learn a new technology that might get the throne in the cross-platform apps development world.

### Prototype
We experimented the technology we were going to use throughout the semester, namely flutter. To give us confidence, since we already have made the mock ups, we made a prototype of the pages with hardcoded information just to create the structure of the app. The user stories that were implemented were the agenda, personal agenda, profile and event page.

---
## Test

Because the main focus of the testing aspect was mainly just to experiment and learn more about acceptance testing using Gherkin, we opted to choose a set of important functionalities and features and develop some tests to make sure they were working properly. The tests are all done automatically. However, at this moment only developed one test using gherkin since integrating it into flutter was not as friendly as we initially expected, and would required a lot of code to be restructured.

The planned features to be tested are:

* Write a comment on forum;
* Message other users;
* See event's details;
* Build my own agenda.

## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project’s artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).


---

## Project management

For the Software project management the group opted to use [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/com) for it's simplicity and usability, where we do things such as registering tasks, assing taks, add estimations to taks, monitor tasks progress, etc.
We can also filter the tasks according to the project's iteration:

Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.
